# library
Create your own library of books and track whether you've read them or not!

Dev Notes:
The focus of this project was using objects and object constructors in JS. Since the library will have many books, it is
a perfect opportunity to use an object constructor for a book!  When a user enters a new book into the library, a book
object is created and added to the library.
